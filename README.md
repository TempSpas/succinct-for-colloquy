Changed the default theme with some color tweaks of my own, reducing contrast. Also
added two variants, Solarized and Solarized Dark, based on http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized.
Nickname coloring comes courtesy of willasaywhat <https://github.com/willasaywhat>.

Download & Install Instructions:
--------------------------------

If you're finding this theme by google and don't really know what you're doing, you're
exactly like me when I found the original. Steps to download:

1. To the upper right, there's a button called "Download ZIP". Download and unzip it.
2. Move all the contents of the folder except "Succinct.colloquyStyle" to the trash. You don't
need them. 
3. Open an additional Finder window and, from the Finder's "Go" menu, select
   "Go to Folder..." . In the dialog pane that appears, enter:
     /Library/Application Support/Colloquy/Styles
4. Drag "Succinct.colloquyStyle" there.

Restart Colloquy or type /reload styles into Colloquy.

Editing Instructions:
---------------------

Again, when I found the original theme, I wanted to change a lot of the features myself,
beyond what Colloquy allows you to do in the preferences menu. Here are instructions to tweak
the themes to your liking if you've already download them.

1. Locate the file. (Open a Finder window and, from the "Go" menu, select "Go to Folder..."
and enter: /Library/Application Support/Colloquy/Styles
2. Right click "Succinct.colloquyStyle" and select "Show Package Contents."
3. Navigate to Contents -> Resources.
4. To change colors in the default theme, edit Main.css. To change Solarized colors, double click
the folder labeled "Variants."
5. The CSS files inside this folder are clearly labeled and ready to edit.

I used [this website](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp) to pick colors.

Colloquy (<http://colloquy.info>) is a very nice IRC application for Mac OS X,
but its included chat styles are in need of some serious design and usability
work. Succinct is an add-on style that is designed to be the "missing style" for
Colloquy and is inspired by 37signals's Campfire design, but re-purposed for IRC
communication.


Four reasons to love "Succinct" for Colloquy
--------------------------------------------

1. Simple clean design.
2. Emphasizes what you need.
3. De-emphasizes what you donâ€™t.
4. Customize what you hate.

Installation
------------

All Colloquy styles need to be placed in your home directory's Library folder at
~/Library/Application Support/Colloquy/Styles. New styles become available after
you restart Colloquy.

1. After you have downloaded, installed and started Colloquy, download the
   latest version of the Succinct style from the "tags" page on GitHub:
   https://github.com/JohnAlbin/succinct-for-colloquy/tags

2. Double-click the downloaded .zip (or .tar.gz) file and open the newly
   created succinct-for-colloquy folder to find the Succinct.colloquyStyle file.

3. Open an additional Finder window and, from the Finder's "Go" menu, select
   "Go to Folder..." . In the dialog pane that appears, enter:
     ~/Library/Application Support/Colloquy/Styles

4. Copy the file Succinct.colloquyStyle file from the folder in Step 2 to the
   Styles folder from Step 3.

5. Start or re-start Colloquy.


Configuration
-------------

To change the style of one chatroom/channel, find the "Style" drop-down menu in
the top left of the Colloquy's main window and select the "Succinct" option.

Or, to set Succinct as your default Colloquy style, choose the "Appearance
Preferences..." option from that "Style" drop-down menu.

You can customize Succinct's colors and features by visiting the "Appearance"
tab in Colloquy's preferences and clicking the "Customize Style..." button.
